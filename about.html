            <p>Hi, my name is Jan Frederik Hake. I am a software developer from Dortmund / Germany.</p>
<p>I’ve been coding for years on different topics. I prefer do work as a full stack engineer, because every part of an application has its challenge and its charm.</p>
<p>I have been working on / with</p>
<ul>
<li>clustered relational databases with hundreds of tables and thousands of stored procedures</li>
<li>code bases with millions of lines of code</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)">brownfield</a> projects / products</li>
<li>document based database systems with millions of documents and terabytes in size</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">extjs</a> based web applications</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my personal blog, where I write about programming, infrastructure and own ideas. I start with some simple pages and let this blog grow as needed.</p>
