            <a href="./posts/2017-02-20-pandoc-filter.html">using pandoc filters to create graphs with hakyll</a> - February 20, 2017
            
            <p>
                <p>When you want to convert one document format into an other, <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Pandoc</a> is your friend. <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Hakyll</a> is using it for converting Markdown into HTML. Once installed (eg. via cabal / stack) you can call pandoc from command line.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo &quot;# test&quot; | pandoc -t native
[Header 1 (&quot;test&quot;,[],[]) [Str &quot;test&quot;]]</code></pre>
<p>This simple example shows the native format. A list of definitions can be found at <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-types-1.17.0.5/docs/Text-Pandoc-Definition.html">Hackage</a>. Every document format read is converted into this native format. It is the pandoc internal representation of the document.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo &quot;# test&quot; | pandoc -w html
&lt;h1 id=&quot;test&quot;&gt;test&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can get a html output as well. A <a href="http://pandoc.org/scripting.html">pandoc filter</a> can be used to inject a custom behavior between reading and writing a document. This feature is needed to write filters to work with Hakyll</p>

            <p>
                <p>Last year I started a little web project for work. After probing some frameworks, I started with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">react</a>. I must say, the tooling around the framework is quite sophisticated.</p>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> is needed for the build tool chain. Via <code>npm install create-react-app -g</code> you’ve got a good point to start. It installs the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">tool chain</a>, needed for creating a development environment.</p>

                <p>This year is almost done. I got a new place for work and found a new old friend the <a href="https://www.bahn.de">Deutsche Bahn</a>. My way to work consist now of cycling and going by train.</p>

            <p>
                <p>After almost four years, I am moving on towards a new job. Removing the german holydays, weekends and vacations, there are only 23 working days left.</p>
<p>This is not very much time, considering the work, which have to be completed before I leave. So I decided to build something simple to direct my attention to the last days.</p>

                <p>According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909">User Story Mapping, 44ff</a> there are several ways to grow a product. You can take the requirements as given and build a product peace by peace. Finally you deliver it all, or try to build working products with each iteration.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Weeks ago my colleagues and I had a discussion about code ownership. Over years ownership may skip over to other developers e.g. due to job change. For a approximation you can start with the files, checked in to repository. I will use the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.git">Angular.js</a> repository for demonstrations.</p>

                <p>When you think about programming, you will have writing code in mind. Although pressing you ideas into executable code is one of the finest discipline for a software engineer, but it doesn’t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>There are some techniques and abilities, a good software developer should have from my point of view.</p>

            <p>
                <p>After working over months with several developers on one repository, a little bit “tree care” is necessary. Usually old merged branches are deleted on server, when they are not needed any more.</p>
