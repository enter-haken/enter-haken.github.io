<p>According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909">User Story Mapping, 44ff</a> there are several ways to grow a product. You can take the requirements as given and build a product peace by peace. Finally you deliver it all, or try to build working products with each iteration.</p>

<p>Henrik Kniberg revisit this topic in a resent <a href="http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp">blog post</a> in a more detailed way.</p>
<p>When you are developing a new product, what is your skateboard? If you develop a todo application for example, maybe a simple textbox with a resulting textfield may be your skateboard.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>You are able to insert todo items and revisit them later. On the next iteration you may delete items.</p>

<p>This could be your mvp. You have a product, some early adopters can work with.</p>
<p>Depending on the market other features may become relevant.</p>
<ul>
<li>user management / logon / oauth â€¦</li>
<li>grouping items</li>
<li>managing user groups</li>
</ul>
<p>When you try to keep these iterations as small as possible, with every iteration a user can help workout a better solution. The possibility to work against the customer is minimized dramatically.</p>
<p>If you create a product by your own, you can either choose to build a product until you have your 100%, or grow your application step by step, and integrate others into your ideas.</p>
<p>If you are working on a project, the customer must play along. There are contracts to fulfill and often there are several parties in the game.</p>
<p>When you decide for a mvp approach for a non trivial application, you have to decide how to iterate throw the production cycle. Among other things <a href="../posts/2016-02-27-getting-better.html#take-care-of-your-data">you have to care for your data</a> over all iterations, what becomes more complicated on a multilayered application.</p>
